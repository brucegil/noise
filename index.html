        NEW YORK —Loud noise is common in Washington Heights and Inwood, but residents say this year has been the loudest of them all. </a>

        <br />
        <br />
        "This year is 50 times louder than any other year," says Claudia Schaer, who has lived in Inwood since 2003 and created the “WaHi and Inwood for Respectful Decibel Levels” Facebook Group this past May.
        <br />
        <br />
        This year complaints for loud music in Manhattan Community District 12 have increased 115 percent compared to the same period last year, according to NYC Open Data.
        <br />
        <br />
        Previous research suggests that an increase in 311 complaints is connected to gentrification, but this year’s spike in complaints does not follow past trends.
        <br />
        <br />
        "It's not about the type of music that people are listening to, but about the decibel levels that affect everyone," says Schaer.
        <br />
        <br />
        The group is advocating for solutions that move away from the complaint system and minimize law enforcement involvement.
        <br />
